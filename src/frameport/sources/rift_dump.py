"""Find Oculus Rift (Windows PC VR) games on disk.

When scanning, the chosen folder's subfolders are the games (the folder itself only if a program sits directly in
it). A subfolder is **one game** when it has candidate programs (see analysis.rift.candidates), no APKs (those are Quest
dumps) and all candidates sit at its top level or under a single subfolder — repacks put the game one or more levels
down, next to installers and archives. Otherwise it's a **collection**: every subfolder is one game (or, again, a
collection), e.g. ARMGDDN_PCVR_OCULUS/<Game vX -TAG>/<Game>/…/Game.exe. Loose programs in a collection are ignored.
